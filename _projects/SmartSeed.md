This is an open source image editing software modeled after Adobe Photoshop. I hope that I can use as many AI algorithms as possible to make it feature rich. Currently, this project is still in production, so stay tuned.

## Environment

- Python 3.6
- PyQt 5.9
- OpenCV 3.4
- TensorFlow CPU/GPU 1.4
- Keras 2.1

## Progress

### v 1.0

Currently, the functions that have been implemented are as follows:

- New artboard
- Open picture
- Save picture
- Pencil tool
- Straight line tool
- 10 filters
- Automatic white balance

### v 1.1

Fix some bugs, add new features:

- Blurry filters
- Sharp filters
- Undo & Redo
- Some other filters
- Rectangle tool
- Ellipse tool
- Layer structure

### v 1.2

fix the bug of Layer structure, add new features:

- Canvas size
- Image size

## Usage

Use shell
1. Clone and Download
```shell
git clone https://github.com/Quanfita/SmartSeed.git
cd SmartSeed/
```
2. Environment Configure
