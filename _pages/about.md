I am a Independent Researcher of Computer Graphics, and I am interested in Computer Graphics, Image Processing, and Machine Learning. Earlier, I obtained my bachelor degree from the Department of Information Science and Engineering at Hebei University of Science & Technology, advised by [Guanghua Zhang](https://xxxy.web.hebust.edu.cn/jyjx/yjsjy/ssjy/guanghua.htm) at [HEBUST](https://www.hebust.edu.cn). 

Research
======
My research is Computer Graphics. During my undergraduate studies, I published the first paper in my life on the colorization of images. In this article, I used an enhanced U-net network structure to enhance Cycle-GAN, and used it to perform image colorization tasks, and achieved good results.
